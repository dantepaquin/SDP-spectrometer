# Repository for KiCad Libraries and design

Individual design files (footprints & symbols) will go into part-specific subfolders in the "Separate" folder

KiCad organization basics:  
.LIB files store SCHEMATIC SYMBOLS  
.PRETTY folders store FOOTPRINT MODELS  
The two should be associated in their current form. 

Further work includes building basic building-block circuits so that integration is easier later on.
